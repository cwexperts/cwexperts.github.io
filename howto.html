      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>The general idea you need to get is that we start a game on one world and after 10 minutes, we start a different 
      game on another world with our losers while the original game is still going on. By doing this, we can do games 
      in ~13 minutes instead of 23 minutes full games and receive about 9-10 tickets per hour.
      </p>
      
      <h3>CwExperts Bot Commands</h3>
      <p>We have our own bot in the games channel <code>#cwexperts1</code> which you are 
      given access to after your nick registration. The bot helps us run games so everyone can be notified 
      when an action needs to be done such as hopping worlds or lobbing for others.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><kbd>.w</kbd> is used when you want to find out which world to go to</li>
        <li><kbd>.ls</kbd> is usually only used when you miss joining the game and need people on sara to lobby</li>
        <li><kbd>.lz</kbd> is used when you need the losers on zammy to lobby for more to join the game</li>
        <li><kbd>.unlobby</kbd> is used only if you are the leader or if you were last person to join the game</li>
        <li><kbd>.hopw</kbd> should be only used by the leader to notify everyone of the next world</li>
        <li><kbd>.mhl</kbd> should be used if you <b>have</b> to notify everyone of something, such as crashers</li>
        <li><kbd>.lead</kbd> should be used to pick a random person to be the leader</li>
        <li><kbd>.salt</kbd> should be used to pick a random person to be the salt</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Basics</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Join <code>#cwexperts1</code> and use the <kbd>.w</kbd> command to find the current world</li>
        <li>Go to said world and put your main in Saradomin portal and your loser goes into Zamorak portal</li>
        <li>Once you're in portal, wait for message to join the game and join immediately</li>
        <li>As soon as you join the game, you <b>HAVE</b> to lobby for others to get in until leader calls unlobby</li>
        <li>Once the game ticks (5v5) and the time is 10+3, leader will notify you to hop your loser to a different world</li>
        <li>Your loser has to be in-game on Zamorak side before it hops worlds, otherwise it 
        will not go automatically into Zamorak portal on the next world</li>
        <li>The basic role is simple, to not AFK to respond to calls and to make sure your loser is logged in throughout the game</li>
        <li>The game will end on the previous world, where your main was, and now your main
        will hop to the next world to join the new game</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Salting</h3>
      <p>Once you have a grasp on the basic role, next step is to learn how to salt and that stands for Saradomin Alt. The 
        idea is when the lead calls hop world and everyone's losers hop to next world to start a new game on a different 
        world, for the lobby timer to start there has to be someone in Saradomin portal since everyone else is in Zamaroak.
      </p>
      <p>This is where the lead and salt's role comes in, both of them go into Saradomin portal to start the timer and 
      once the game starts, each person caps the flag once (2 flags captured per game). After that, they should both leave 
      the game before mains hop and should attempt to join Zamorak portal immediately after leaving the game.
      </p>
      <p><b>Summary</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>When hop world is called, join Saradomin portal instead of Zamorak with your loser</li>
        <li>Capture the Zamorak flag once and score, then leave the game through the portal</li>
        <li>Attempt to join the Zamorak portal so when mains hop, more people are able to join Saradomin portal 
          since they balanced by the combat level 
        </li>
        <li>If you are unable to join the Zamorak portal, wait outside by the bank and remember to join when mains hop</li>
        <li>Once you're in Zamorak portal, wait for tick and join the game only if there aren't enough on Zamorak side in-game</li>
        <li>Rinse & repeat</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Leading</h3>
      <p>Leading games is somewhat similar to being salt, as you do the exact same thing with your loser as you would as salt.
        As lead, you need to pay attention to the message when the game ticks, and after the time hits 10+3 
        you can use the <kbd>.hopw</kbd> to direct users to the next world. Afterwards, you need to put your loser in Saradomin portal 
        with the person salting to start the game then as usual you will cap once before leaving the game.</p>
        
      <p>Now you have to make sure that your loser is in Zamorak portal after scoring & leaving the game, and when 
      mains hop you will join Zamorak portal on your MAIN account as well as your loser. So both accounts are in 
      Zamorak portal until the time hits 12+3, then you can leave portal to check if anyone is still outside. 
      The reason for this is that the lead is always the last person in and has to make sure everyone else joined the game.
      </p>
      
      <p>Assuming nobody is left outside trying to join the portal, you can go ahead and join the Saradomnin portal and 
        wait for the message to join the game. As soon as you join, you have to use the <kbd>.unlobby</kbd> command to 
        notify everyone that they can unlobby and this has to be as soon as time hits 10+3 or before if you joined the game 
        earlier.
      </p>
      
      <p><b>Summary</b></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Assuming you are already in game, once the game ticks and the time is 10+3, use the <kbd>.hopw</kbd> to 
          direct users to the next world of your choice (you may alternate between the same 2-3 worlds)
        </li>
         <li>When hop world is called, join Saradomin portal instead of Zamorak with your loser</li>
        <li>Capture the Zamorak flag once and score, then leave the game through the portal</li>
        <li>Attempt to join the Zamorak portal so when mains hop, more people are able to join Saradomin portal 
          since they balanced by the combat level 
        </li>
        <li>If you are unable to join the Zamorak portal, wait outside by the bank and remember to join when mains hop</li>
        <li>When mains hop, your MAIN and your LOSER both have to be in Zamorak portal, allowing more people to 
        join game in same tick</li>
        <li>Wait in the portal until nobody else is outside Saradomin portal (usually around 12+3), then you may join 
          the Saradomin portal to join the game
        </li>
        <li>As soon as you join the game on your main, use the <kbd>.unlobby</kbd> command to notify everyone that they 
          can unlobby. Make sure to call unlobby as soon as you join and not after 10+3.
        </li>
        <li>Rinse & repeat</li>
      </ol>
