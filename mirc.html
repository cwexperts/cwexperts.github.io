      <h2>mIRC for Noobs</h2>
      <p>Right, since the web client is god awful and keeps glitching out either failin to connect or highlights breaking.
      Here's a little mIRC guide for all you noobs out there. Get on the miRC train.</p>
          
      <h3>Download</h3>
      <p>You can easily google mIRC but I'll save you the trouble and go ahead and 
      <a href="www.mirc.co.uk/get.php" target="_blank">click this link</a>. Install it just like any other program
      and start it up.</p>
      
      <h3>Options</h3>
      <p>When you start mIRC it'll tell you to buy it or continue for like 30 days, but don't worry after the 30 days
       you can just skip that message by waiting a few seconds. Follow these steps when you're on the options window,
        if you can't find the options menu press Alt+O.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>On Connect, enter your nickname that you registered on SwiftIRC. You don't need to enter your real name or email.</li>
        <li>On the left side, press Servers and look for SwiftIRC. Click on "Random server" and press Select.
        <li>On the left side, press Options. Tick the "Connect on startup" option and untick the "Show connect on startup".</li>
        <li>Press the Perform button on the right side and tick the "Enable perform on connect option".</li>
        <li>Press the Add button and look for SwiftIRC, press add and make sure it's selected in the "Network".</li>
        <li>In the box below "Perform commands", refer to this <a href="http://puu.sh/gQURk.png">puush</a>. Make sure it looks like it does 
        in the picture and obviously changing "YOURPASSWORD" to your actual IRC password.</li>
        <li>Press OK and go back to the Connect on the left side and finally press Connect. Welcome to IRC.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>mIRC Highlights</h3>
      <p>Once you've connected, you want to get your highlights. Press Alt+B, and click on the Highlight tab. Make sure you 
      tick the "Enable highlight" option and then press add, and make it does in this <a href="http://puu.sh/gQTAW.png">puush</a>. 
      Press OK to save. Test that your highlights are working using the .hl command in the channel.</p>
